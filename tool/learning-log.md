### 9/29/25: Day 1
* I changed the “Add” button by adding inline styles such as background color, padding, and rounded corners as well as changing the label to “Add Task ✅.” The small visual tweak makes the button stand out and shows that I adjusted the UI beyond the starter code.
    * Original `<button onClick={addTask}>Add</button>`
    * After `<button onClick={addTask} style={{ backgroundColor: "#4CAF50", color: "white", padding: "5px 10px", borderRadius: "5px" }}> Add Task ✅ </button>`
